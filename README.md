AI Enterprise Workflow Capstone Project 

## Master Template including the necessary inputs
Details to the master could be find under: 
https://github.com/aavail/ai-workflow-capstone

## Solution

Notebooks created and run with Anaconda on Mac with Python 3
Each Notebook creates the necessary logic in own python runtime files

The project setup is based on the file structure given in project-setup.py. This setup will create a runtime directory where all outputfiles (logs, models, data, images) are placed during runtime.
